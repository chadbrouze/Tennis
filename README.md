## Enviroment Details

This environment is called the Tennis Environment. It consists of two agents (rackets) whose goal is to bounce a ball over a net to each other. If the agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of 0.1; if the ball hits the ground or goes out of bounds, it gets a reward of -0.01. The goal of the agents is to maximise the cumulative reward per episode. The state-space consists of 8 variables corresponding to the position and velocity of the ball and the agent's racket. The action space is a w number vector representing jumping and movement relative to the net. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1. The environment is solved once the agent receives an average score of 0.5 over 100 consecutive episodes. This equates to an average rally of 9 to 10 shots.
